# ITER: Iterative Training and Efficient Refinement

### Automated Traffic Sign Detection Framework based on YOLO

---

## Overview

ITER is a fully automated YOLOv-based pipeline designed for traffic sign detection in complex Indian road environments. It incorporates innovative self-learning techniques including auto-annotation, failure-case mining, and iterative retraining to continuously improve detection accuracy.

## Key Features

- End-to-end automated pipeline for traffic sign detection and annotation
- Auto-annotation of new traffic sign instances with minimal human intervention
- Failure-case mining to identify and improve upon model weaknesses
- Iterative retraining for continuous performance enhancement
- High F1-score above 98% demonstrating strong precision-recall balance

## Dataset

- Introduced a new Indian Traffic Sign Detection Dataset (ITSDD) tailored for India-specific road signs and conditions

## Current Status

- The full codebase is currently being finalized and is not fully published yet.
- This repository contains early-stage code and project documentation.
- Full implementation will be released publicly soon.

## Installation

Instructions will be provided upon full code release.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions, scripts, and pipeline commands will be available with the complete release.

## Contribution

Contributions and feedback will be welcomed once the full release is published.
